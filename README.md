## assignment 1 (Venue Hire System) 5.5/10
```
Issues with ass1:-
- problem with ordering (lost )
	- booking
- feedback:-

Identified the things involved and the relationships between them but

design a bit overly complex. Command not really needed and it would be

better suited as a class rather than an interface seeming as it

implements eveything and has state. Also the Command is doing a bit much.

Although your other classes have methods that do things, there is still a

fair bit of logic done in Command that could be delegated to other

classes instead of extracting the state.

good javadoc 
```
